# file-splitter-joiner-and-compression

The project is aimed to solve the data wastage which occurs if any network error comes
during sending or downloading the files and to use less disk space. Integrated as a software
which will run on linux and eclipse IDE. It can be achieved by implementing Data
Structures, file handling and Huffman algorithm.
We will be developing a program in C language to solve the problem. C programming
language is the mother of all the other programming languages. C implements algorithms
and data structures swiftly, facilitating faster computations in programs. C is highly portable
and is used for scripting system applications which form a major part of Windows, UNIX,
and Linux operating systems.
File splitter is basically used to split the large files which are not possible to upload or
download, when we have to file size restrictions imposed by the application. For example, if
we need to upload a file say 30 MB using Gmail, than it might not be possible as Gmail
restrict the file size less than 30MB, so if we use our tool we can split the file and send the
splitted parts by uploading it and can retain the original file by joining the splitted parts . File
compression is a process of "packaging" a file (or files) to use less disk space. Compression
software allows you to take many files and compress them into one file, which is smaller
than the combined size of the originals.Compression frees up drive space and closes up
memory gaps, reducing the time needed to locate data on a drive. Speed up backups.
Compressed files transfer faster and use less bandwidth than their uncompressed
counterparts. A good compression strategy thus supports an effective backup plan.
